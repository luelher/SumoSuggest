<h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Privacy Policy</h1>
<span>For SumoSuggest.com.</span> 
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At SumoSuggest.com we have adapted the privacy policy from Wordpress that follow a few fundamental principles:</p>

<p><strong>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</strong></p>

<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.</p>

<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.</p>

<p>It is SumoSuggest.com's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>


<p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>

<p>Like most website operators, SumoSuggest.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SumoSuggest.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SumoSuggest.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SumoSuggest.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>SumoSuggest.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. SumoSuggest.com only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below</p>


<p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>

<p>Certain visitors to SumoSuggest.com's choose to interact with SumoSuggest.com in ways that require SumoSuggest.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SumoSuggest.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide an email address. SumoSuggest.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with SumoSuggest.com. SumoSuggest.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>


<p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>

<p>SumoSuggest.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SumoSuggest.com's behalf or to provide services available at SumoSuggest.com's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SumoSuggest.com's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SumoSuggest.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SumoSuggest.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SumoSuggest.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SumoSuggest.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user at SumoSuggest.com and have supplied your email address, SumoSuggest.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with SumoSuggest.com. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SumoSuggest.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
